# Hardhat-reef-template
Hardhat-reef-template is used to create a new Hardhat project for the Reef-chain.
It includes all the essentials dependencies used to develop Reef contracts.

## Installing
Clone template and configure the new project name.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:reef-defi/hardhat-reef-template.git project-name
```

Install all dependencies with `yarn`.

You are good to go!

## Running
Write scripts under the `scripts` directory and run them using the following run template...
```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/{script-name}.js
```

The default Greeter contract script can be run using the following command...
```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js
```


## Configure
Define your Reef chain URL in `hardhat.config.js` (by default `ws://127.0.0.1:9944`):

Hardhat-reef uses the default network `reef`.
If the user wants to run the script on the other network, he can do so in CLI with `--network {network-name}` flag.

Example:
```bash
yarn hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js --network hardhat
```

Users can define the network configuration in `hardhat.config.js`.
He can switch the `defaultNetwork` to the desired one.

Configuring the Reef network, the user can edit its URL. If the URL exists (can be pinged), the system will automatically connect to it, else it will run internal `Reef-Node` and try to connect to it.

The default configuration has `reef` defined as the default network, and its URL is set to: `ws://127.0.0.1:9944`.
```javascript
module.exports = {
	solidity: "0.7.3",
  defaultNetwork: "reef" // just an example of picking the desired network. This line is not needed!
};
```

Users can modify their values by replacing the existing ones like so...
```javascript
module.exports = {
	solidity: "0.7.3",
  networks: {
		reef: {
			url: "ws://127.0.0.1:9944",
		}
	},
};
```

Connect to the reef-testnet...
```javascript
module.exports = {
	solidity: "0.7.3",
  networks: {
		reef: {
			url: "wss://rpc-testnet.reefscan.com/ws",
		}
	},
};
```
